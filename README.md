Overview
========

This repo has a single purpose: To compile unofficial binaries of 
the BitcoinSV merchant api (mAPI). Namely for useage in the 
[ElectrumSV SDK](https://pypi.org/project/electrumsv-sdk) which aims
to provide a first-class RegTest developer experience for running a local
(or cloud / pipelines-based) node and mAPI instance as well as other relevant
services that many bitcoin applications depend on.
